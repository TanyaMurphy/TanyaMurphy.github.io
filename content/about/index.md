I'm an epidemiologist and data analyst. I got my PhD in epidemiology and biostatistics from McGill University in Montreal, Canada in December 2020. (Yup, I defended on Zoom because of covid-19...)

In my research projects, I have used longitudinal models, psychometric and biomarker measurement validation, multiple imputation for missing data, and Bayesian inference, as well as the staples of epidemiology (descriptive stats and data visualization, adjustment or weighting for representativeness and control of confounding, survival analysis).

I'm not at liberty to share the data I used for most projects so I repeated some of the analysis methods with open data sources on this blog.

Recent substantive topics have been in child health and development, specifically adiposity and obesity, eating attitudes, behavioural self-regulation, childcare and social determinants of health. Many years ago, I did HIV and hepatitis C clinical epidemiology.
