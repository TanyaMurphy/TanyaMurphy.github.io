Life is messy! but that makes population sciences fun---or so I'll try to convince you with these posts on data analysis in R. 

Child health and development research are my main health interests. Modelling and measurement issues abound in this research. I'm not usually at liberty to share the data I use for epidemiology projects so I repeated some of the analysis techniques with open data sources.

My expertise is really in epidemiological data analysis (I team up with pediatricians and allied health professionals). In my research projects, I have used longitudinal models, psychometric and biomarker measurement validation, multiple imputation for missing data, and Bayesian inference, as well as the staples of epidemiology (descriptive stats and data visualization, regression with adjustment or weighting for representativeness and control of confounding, survival analysis).
