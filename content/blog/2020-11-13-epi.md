[Fast forward to the analysis post](/2020/11/13-intro-billboard-data)

Epidemiology study data is typically collected with surveys and clinical or administrative databases. Although less structured data such as social media posts and qualitative research interviews are increasingly used, they are not typical. Therefore, most epi data analysts receive the raw data in the form of one or more rectangular datasets. SAS and SPSS formats are very common, as are Excel files, but [Excel tables are risky]().

There is usually **a lot** of data cleaning and wrangling to do.
